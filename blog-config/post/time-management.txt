We all get the same, 24 hours. Why is it that some people achieve so much more with their time than others? 
> You can't save time, you can only spend it but you can spend it wisely or foolishly.

While most of us still stress and struggle with emergencies and urgencies, some people have found a way out.
Everybody is familiar with the Eisenhower Method. Tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent.

1. Important and urgent tasks are done immediately and personally e.g. deadlines
2. Important but not urgent tasks are planned are done personally e.g. familly time
3. Not important but urgent tasks are delegated e.g. most emails
4. Not important and not urgent tasks are dropped e.g. time wasters 

Nothing wrong with that, it's just that in some situations it's not enough.

When you feel that 24h are not enought and you start classifying important and urgent stuff as more importnat and more urgent, you have to stop and think. Think about tomorrow, and the day after and the day after...

Think of what you can do today that will allow you to have more time tomorrow...

Give permission to yourself to take the time to automate repetitive tasks.
Delegate more to your people, it will increase their motivation and allow you to concentrate on tasks that you really care about.
Dare to say No!
 
Instead of figuring out how to fit more into a day take the time to figure out how to spend your time wisely.
