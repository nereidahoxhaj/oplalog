- goals, objectives

SMART goals  are most commonly defined as Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. But let's stop there for a moment and clarify the meaning of "goals".

> A goal is defined as the purpose toward which an endeavour is directed.

Example: I want to achieve success in the field of theoretical physics and do what no one has ever done.

> An objective on the other hand is something that one's efforts or actions are intended to accomplish.

Example: I want to complete this thesis on string theory by the end of this month.

When we speak about "SMART" goals we actually mean objectives.

Now with that clarified, some of those SMART criteria like Specific and Measurable are perfectly fine.
But pay attention to the Achievable and Realistic. Often they act as impediment and encourage mediocre and poor performance.
They seem to say: “Don’t push beyond your resources, play it safe and stay within your limitations.” Don’t fall into that trap!

Achievable and Realistic objectives are important to keep the motivation high but make sure they are ambitious enough. 

Don't let the SMART objectives get you too focused on incremental improvement and distract you from the really big, meaningful magic we're all capable of.
 
So: Have impossible goals and SMART objectives, and you just might achieve the impossible.
