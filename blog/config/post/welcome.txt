Hello and welcome to the simplest blog ever! Although there are some good blog frameworks out there we decided to build our own and share it with you.
Two reasons for building our own blog:
1. Because we're geek
2. Because we were looking for a blog with no database and editable offline.

And this is what we came up with.
To learn more check out the Getting started post.
